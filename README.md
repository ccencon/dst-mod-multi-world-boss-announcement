# Multi-World Boss Announcement

## Statement

fork from <https://github.com/jupitersh/dst-mod-multi-world-boss-announcement>

respect the src.

## Modify

Most of the time, the file `modoverrides.lua` is the same in different clusters. From my tactic, i will copy this file to the game root dir and create symbolic links to it. But in the src code, we must modify separate `modoverrides.lua` in different clusters, i have to modify the src code to fit my tactic

Another reason is that i want to add the new boss announcement in "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked"
